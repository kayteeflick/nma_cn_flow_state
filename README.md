Neuromatch Academy 2021 Computational Neuroscience analysis of Steinmetz 2019 data.

Project guidelines:

1. finding a phenomenon and a question to ask about it
  What's different about a mouse not looking/correct/incorrect? Is the task difficulty represented in the data, e.g. dimensionality. How is this information reflected between brain areas and the flow between it? What is the underlying structure, and how is it related to different times in the trial/task difficulty?

2. understanding the state of the art
  PCA, dimensionality reduction, phase synchrony, phase amplitude coupling

3. determining the basic ingredients
  Timing of when different parts of the trials occur, task difficulty based on contrast levels, spike counts, LFP downsampled to 100 Hz

4. formulating specific, mathematically defined hypotheses
  Mice make incorrect trials, and there must be some difference in the underlying structure. We believe we can find differences in the underlying structure and flow of information between brain areas based on task diffculty and correct, incorrec, and no go trials
